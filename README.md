# Next Starter

This provides a nextjs website with some basic components and a blog set up.

It includes packages such as mui5 (as well as all the wiring wizardry to get that working correctly), Slider (for nice sliding panel behavior), and a the guts to make your blog posts look nice.

This is essentially what was used to create www.palavyr.com - you'd like to see an example.
